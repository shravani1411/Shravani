1. keep reading numbers from user, and write those numbers to a file. Once user presses -1, stop reading, and print all the contents of the file. Open the file everytime with previous contents intact (append mode).

2. Open the file  in append mode, and write new numbers to it, and print entire content of the file.

3. Read the contents of a file and copy to another file.

4. Create a new file using contents of two files.(append one file content to another, and write to a third file).

5. Two files data1 and data2 contain sorted list of integers. Write a program to produce a third file data which holds a single,sorted, merged list of these two files. Use command line arguments to specify the file names.

6. Write a program that compares two files and returns 0 if they are equal and 1 if they are not equal.

7. Write a program that reads a file containing integers and appends the sum of all integers at the end.

8. Write a program to write a set of characters to a file, and read and print the contents in reverse.

9. Write a program that opens a file with some number of characters written in it.
 An integer input is taken. If the input is positive, skip those many characters and print the remaining till end of the file. If the input is negative, then print those man y characters till end of the file.
	eg., file contents :abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	input number: 15, output: pqrstuvwxyz
	input number: -10 , output: qrstuvwxyz

10. Write a program, using structures to read details of n students,with details,ID,name,fathername,date of birth and marks, and write those details to a file, one line per student, each detail separated by a comma. The first record must be a Heading. Open the file with .csv extension.

11. Write a program to read the above file and print who is topper.

12. Assume that there is a file with 0 to 1000 numbers. Take input of two integers, and replace the first integer with next.
	Eg., 365 ,563
	365 must be replaced everywhere with 563.

13. WAP to take an input string from the user, and delete the given word n number of times from a file.
	Eg., input : world , 5
	Find and delete the word “world” in a file 5 times.

14. Read numbers entered by user and write to a file. Open the file and read the numbers and write even numbers to even file and odd numbers to odd file.
