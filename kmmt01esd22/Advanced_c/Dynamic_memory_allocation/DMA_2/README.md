#Date:29-11-2-2022; Topic: Dynamic memory allocation 2

1) "Write a trim() function,that will remove the leading and trailing spaces from a string.
	eg., Input : ""    str  str   ""
	Output : ""str str"""

2) Implement your own realloc function using malloc and free using below steps: 
	- Allocate memory for new size using malloc
	- copy data from old address to new address
	- release the old address
	- return the new address

3) Write a string concatenation function that calculates the source string length, accordingly adjusts the size of destination string before concatenating the strings, to avoid size issues. For this the destination must be allocated dynamically in calling function.

4) Read a set of words from the user and concatenate all of them to make a sentence and print it back using the concatenation function above with spaces as delimiters and fullstop as end of the sentence.

	input: 
	Kernel
	Masters
	is
	India's
	leading
	training
	institute.

	output: Kernel Masters is India's leading training institute.

5) "Write a function that takes a main string and two sub strings (need not be same length), and replace every occurrence of first substring with the second substring in main string and return a new string as output.

	eg., input : kernel  e   xxx
	output: kxxxrnxxxl"

6) Write a program to read a set of strings from a user and print which string is the smallest of all ( in string comparison, smallest string means that should come the first in dictionary sorting order). Create the strings dynamically. 

7) read a set of numbers from the user, and convert each integer to string using itoa function that you have written yesterday, and print the numeric string in calling function in the same loop.
