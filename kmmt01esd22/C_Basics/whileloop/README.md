1)Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to a given number.

2)Write a program to print all odd numbers first and even numbers next in a single program between two given numbers.

3)Write a program to print the multiplication table for a given number.

4) Write a program to read the number of inputs ,and then read those many numbers and print if each number is positive ,negative or zero.

5)Read the marks for 6 subjects for n students( number of students is input) , and find their percentage and print their grade according to below grading:
	80 - 100        : Honours
	60 - 79         : First Division
	50 - 59         : Second Division
	40 - 49         : Third Division
	0 - 39          : Fail

6) Read a set of n numbers (n is input) and print if each given number is smaller or bigger than the previous number. For first number there will not be any output as there is no previous number.
	eg., input number of values: 5
	enter 1st value: 6
	enter 2nd value: 7
	7 is bigger than 6
	enter 3rd value: 5
	5 is smaller than 7
	enter 4th value: 18
	18 is bigger than 5
	enter 5th value: 6
	6 is smaller than 18

7) Read a set of n numbers only in ascending order. While reading the numbers, if the user enters a bigger number than previous number, then continue to next number. If the number is smaller than previous number, then do not count it, and take input again.

	eg., number of values: 5
	enter 1st value: 7
	enter 2nd value: 9
	enter 3rd value: 5
	Sorry, Thats smaller than previous number.
	enter 3rd value: 7
	Sorry, Thats smaller than previous number.
	enter 3rd value: 10
	enter 4th value: 18
	enter 5th value: 6
	Sorry, Thats smaller than previous number.
	enter 5th value: 20
	Thank you for the successful inputs.

9)read n number of characters as input, and print if each character is alphabet or not.

10) read the dates of birth of n students, print the date in a changed format and print a message when the date of birth belongs to a leap year.

	eg.,input number of students: 3
	input student1 date of birth: 2-3-2000
	date is: 2 March 2000
	this student is born in a leap year.

	input student2 date of birth: 12-7-2001
