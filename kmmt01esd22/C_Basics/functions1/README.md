4)"write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1, if the number is prime number and 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message.
	return type is integer.
	IsPrime - returns int (0,1)"

5)"Write a program with a function that takes two integer arguments, and prints all prime numbers between those numbers using the prime number function written above.return type should be void.
PrintAllPrimes - return type is void. Should use IsPrime() function written in Q3 to identify if given number is prime or not."

Hint: int fun_alpha_num(char c)"
