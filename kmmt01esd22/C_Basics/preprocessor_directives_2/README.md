1)"1. Need to display different welcome messages depending on the operating system. Define the macro inside the code and compile the following into 3 different executables.
for WINDOWS : Microsoft Windows Welcomes you
for Linux : Linux Welcomes you
for Mac : Mac Welcomes you"

2)"1. Need to display different welcome messages depending on the operating system. Define the macro from gcc command. Implement a warning incase the macro is not defined.
for WINDOWS : Microsoft Windows Welcomes you
for Linux : Linux Welcomes you
for Mac : Mac Welcomes you"

3)define a macro to generate swapping function for int, float , double and character datatypes, as a generic function using macros.

4)define a macro to generate a generic function that takes prints an array in reverse order. Generate the functions for int, float, double data types.

5)define a macro that generates a function that returns the sum of array elements, for different data typed arrays.

6)in super market program, convert your header file into a header file that can be copy pasted only once, using conditional compiler directives.

7)" Implement a macro to find the size of a variable in bytes ( implement your own sizeof operator).
- Size in bytes can be derived by converting the address of a variable into character address ,and then subtracting it from the next address (address + 1).
 - int x;
sizeof x will be : (char *)(&x + 1) - (char *)&x;
If we implement this as a function, we will have to implement different functions for different data types of the variables.
Implement this using macro, so that it can work for any data type of the variable. "

8) Implement  a macro to find the size of a datatype when the datatype keyword is provided as macro parameter.
