1) Write the following program :
Declare an integer array of size 100.
Assign numbers 1-100 to each element of the array.
Print all the numbers.
Print all even elements.
Print all odd elements.
Add 5 to each element and print 6 – 105 numbers.

2) Write the following program :
Declare a character array without size.
Initialize the array with characters of your name.
Print your name using for loop.

3) Declare an array of size 10. Enter 10 elements and save them in the array. Print the array . Find out the biggest and smallest numbers and print the biggest number and its position in the array, smallest number and its position in the array. Find both using a single loop.

4) Try experimenting with the below array syntaxes and see the results,check their sizes, try to also read values for elements and print them:
	int arr[5] = {};
	int arr[10] = {2.4,5.6,7.3};
	int arr[3] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	int arr[0] = {};
	int arr[0] = {1,2,3,4,5};
	int arr[] = {};
	int arr[‘a’];"

5) Write a program to search for a specific element given by the user, in an array and display where it was found in the array (index).
If the element is available multiple times, then print all positions. also print how many times the element was repeated, at the end. Try todo it in a single loop. Make array size as a variable and take array size as input from the user.

	eg., input array: 1 2 4 6 2 7 3 7 2 3
	enter number to search: 7
	output:
	7 is found at 6th position
	7 is found at 8th position
	7 was repeated 2 times

6) Write a program to print an array in reverse order (From last element to first).

7) Write a program to reverse an array and print it. Do it without using any extra array variable ,by swapping the elements on both ends till we reach the middle of the array.
 
	Input : array1 ={1,2,3,4,5};
	Output : array1 = {5,4,3,2,1}; //array elements stored in reverse order now

8) Write a program to print an integer in binary format.
	eg., input : 17
	output :   10001

9) Write a program to swap two arrays in reverse order.
	array1 : {1,2,3,4,5}
	array2: {6,7,8,9,10}

after swapping output should be as below:

	array1 : { 10,9,8,7,6}
	array2: { 5,4,3,2,1}
