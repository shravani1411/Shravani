1)Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.
	N! = n * n-1 * n-2 * …. 2 * 1
	eg., input: 5
	output: 1*2*3*4*5* = 120
2) Write a program to find the sum of first n serial numbers.
	eg., input : 5
	output: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15

3) Read n values entered by the user and find the sum of the values and print.

4)Read n values entered by the user, and print the sum of positive numbers and negative numbers separately.

5) read few numbers entered by the user and print the sum of the numbers , stop whenever a negative number is entered. Print the number of values entered. Print their average.

6) read n positive numbers from the user and find their sum. If user enters negative number, it should not be counted or added.
