Using if else
1) Read 3 numbers and print which of them is the biggest.

2) Read 4 numbers and print which of them is biggest.

3)Find the power bill for the input number of units :
	0 - 200 units : 100/- min
	201 - 400 units : 100 + 0.65 per unit excess of 200
	401 - 600 units : 230 + 0.80 per unit excess of 400
	601 and above units : 390 + 1.00 per unit excess of 600

4)Find the % of marks for 6 subjects (read 6 subject marks and calculate percentage), for a student, and print the grade of the student as per below division , using if else statement and typecasting operator to get perfect floating point percentage.
	80 - 100        : Honours
	60 - 79         : First Division
	50 - 59         : Second Division

13) Write a program that reads a floating-point number and then displays the right-most digit of the integral part of the number.
