1) List out all the data types and format specifiers
2) Create variables with all data types, and try to read and print their values using scanf and printf.
3) Write a program to calculate simple interest using below steps:

steps: 
a)declare 2 integer variables p and n to represent principle and duration in months respectively.
b)declare a floating point variable r to represent rate of interest.
c)declare a floating point variable si to store simple interest after calculation.
d)declare a floating point variable m to represent time duration in years.
e)print the following indicative message using printf
 "please enter principle,time in months and rate of interest"
f)read the values of p ,n and r using scanf.
g)devide n by 12 using / symbol and store the result in m, to convert time duration from months to years.
Hint : m = n / 12.0;
h)calculate simple interest using the below formula and store in si variable.
si = p * m * r / 100;
i) print si value to the user using printf.

4)Read 4 numbers and calculate their average and print.
eg., 
enter 4 numbers
12 34 57 89
average of 12,34,57 & 89 is: 48

5)calculate area and perimeter of rectangle
6) Calculate area and perimeter of a circle
7) calculate area and perimeter of a square
8)if sale price and profit of n items is given find the cost price of 1 item.
eg., 
input:
number of items : 15
sale price : 500
profit : 50
output: 
cost price of each item: 30/- each
